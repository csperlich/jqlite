## Overview

This is a small library to enable some basic jquery-like DOM manipulation.

## Examples

```javascript
//they go here
```

## Why-oh-why

This (along with a few other js modules), were created for use in a graduate class when we were encouraged to only use what we could develop ourselves.

Plus, what's the point of using something that someone else has written if I could write it myself?

## Installation

Probably going to try to get npm to work. No promises though.

## API

coming soon...

## License

`jqlite` is published under the MIT license.
